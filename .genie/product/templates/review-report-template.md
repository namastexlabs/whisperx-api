## Evidence Summary
| Artefact | Location | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test results | `@wishes/`<slug>/qa/tests.log | ✅ | All 47 tests passing |
| Metrics | `@wishes/`<slug>/qa/metrics.json | ✅ | TTFB avg 410ms (target <500ms) |
| Screenshots | `@wishes/`<slug>/qa/screenshots/ | ✅ | 8 workflow screenshots captured |

## Deductions & Gaps
1. **-2 pts (Discovery):** Risk analysis incomplete in discovery summary
2. **-3 pts (Discovery):** Approval checkpoints not documented before implementation
3. **-1 pt (Implementation):** Extra files modified outside core scope
4. **-2 pts (Implementation):** README not updated with new feature

## Recommendations
1. Add risk analysis to discovery summary section
2. Document approval checkpoints for future wishes
3. Update README with feature documentation
4. Consider splitting peripheral file changes into separate PR

## Verification Commands
Summarize the validation commands executed (per wish instructions and project defaults in `@.genie/code/agents/tests.md` / `@.genie/code/agents/commit.md`) and record pass/fail status for each.

## Verdict
**Score: XX/100 (XX%)**
- ✅ **90-100:** EXCELLENT – Ready for merge
- ✅ **80-89:** GOOD – Minor gaps, approved with follow-ups
- ⚠️ **70-79:** ACCEPTABLE – Needs improvements before merge
- ❌ **<70:** NEEDS WORK – Significant gaps, blocked

**Status:** {APPROVED | APPROVED_WITH_FOLLOWUPS | BLOCKED}

## Next Steps
1. Address gaps 1-4 above (optional for approval, required for excellence)
2. Update wish status to COMPLETED
3. Update wish completion score to XX/100
4. Create follow-up tasks for deferred documentation
