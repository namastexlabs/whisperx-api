# Genie Missing Context Protocol

When critical technical context is missing (files, specs), provide a Files Needed block instead of speculative output.

## Files Needed (use when necessary)

```
status: files_required_to_continue
mandatory_instructions: <what is needed and why>
files_needed: [ path/or/folder, ... ]
```

Use only for technical implementation gaps, not for business/strategy questions.
