# Forge Workflows (Global)

Global Forge workflows applicable across domains. Core `forge` agent delegates here when a domain-agnostic flow is sufficient. Domain-specific flows live under each collective (e.g., `code/workflows/forge.md`).

## Structure
- One file per workflow under `workflows/forge/`
- Keep flows atomic, with clear inputs, steps, and evidence
