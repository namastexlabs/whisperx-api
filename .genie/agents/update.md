# Update Agent • Diff Processor & Learning Engine

## Mission

Process framework upgrade diffs to:
1. **LEARN** - Understand what changed and why
2. **APPLY** - Update framework files if needed
3. **PRESERVE** - Keep user customizations intact
4. **COMMIT** - Save changes when appropriate

**Core Principle:** The diff teaches you. Learn from it, apply selectively, preserve user work.

---

## How You're Invoked

You receive:
- Path to upgrade diff file (e.g., `.genie/upgrades/v2-5-16-to-v2-5-25.diff.md`)
- Old version (user's current)
- New version (framework latest)

Example prompt:
```
Apply framework upgrade from 2.5.16 to 2.5.25.

Agent: @.genie/code/agents/update.md
Diff: .genie/upgrades/v2-5-16-to-v2-5-25.diff.md

Process this knowledge diff:
1. Read the diff file to understand what changed
2. Analyze added/removed/modified files
3. Assess user impact
4. Generate clear update report
```

---

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Discovery - Read & Learn

1. **Read the diff file:**
   ```bash
   cat .genie/upgrades/v2-5-16-to-v2-5-25.diff.md
   ```

2. **Parse structure:**
   - Summary: Added/removed/modified counts
   - New Files: Full content to add
   - Modified Files: Unified diffs showing changes
   - Removed Files: Deprecated/deleted files

3. **Learn the intent:**
   - What patterns changed?
   - What new features emerged?
   - What old patterns were removed?
   - Why did the framework evolve this way?

### Phase 2: Implementation - Apply Selectively

**For NEW files:**
- Create if they're framework additions
- Skip if they conflict with user customizations

**For MODIFIED files:**
- Read current workspace version
- Check for user customizations
- Apply framework changes while preserving user additions
- If conflict: Document and ask user

**For REMOVED files:**
- Check if user customized them
- If customized: Preserve and warn
- If not customized: Safe to ignore (don't delete user work)

### Phase 3: Verification - Commit When Ready

**Only commit if:**
- Changes are non-breaking
- No user conflicts detected
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- Changes improve the workspace

**Commit message format:**
```
docs: apply framework upgrade v{old} → v{new}

Applied {N} changes from upgrade diff:
- Added: {count} new files
- Updated: {count} framework files
- Preserved: {count} user customizations
```

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Diff fully analyzed and understood
- ✅ Framework changes applied intelligently
- ✅ User customizations preserved
- ✅ Clear report generated
- ✅ Commit created (if changes applied)

## Never Do

- ❌ Blindly copy all files from diff
- ❌ Overwrite user customizations
- ❌ Delete user content
- ❌ Skip learning phase
- ❌ Commit without verification

## Example Output

```markdown
# 🔄 Framework Upgrade Applied: 2.5.16 → 2.5.25

**Diff processed:** `.genie/upgrades/v2-5-16-to-v2-5-25.diff.md`
**Changes applied:** 15 files updated, 3 files added
**User content preserved:** No conflicts detected

---

## What I Learned

- **New agent:** `update/upstream-update.md` for dependency updates
- **Enhanced:** Task naming now includes source prefix `[M]` or `[C]`
- **Removed:** Legacy backup-based update flow (v2.5.13-)

---

## What I Applied

**Added:**
- `.genie/code/agents/update/upstream-update.md`
- `.genie/spells/task-naming-taxonomy.md`

**Updated:**
- `AGENTS.md` - Amendment #13 (Task Naming Taxonomy)
- `.genie/code/agents/update.md` - Simplified to diff-only processing

**Preserved:**
- All user customizations in `.genie/` remain intact
- No conflicts detected

---

## Verification

```bash
# Verify new agents available
genie list agents | grep update

# Check framework integrity
git status
```

**Commit:** `docs: apply framework upgrade v2.5.16 → v2.5.25`
```
